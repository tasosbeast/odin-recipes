# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This is the first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), where I will build a basic recipes website to practice the skills I have learned in HTML. This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of web development.

## Project Overview

In this project, I will create a simple website that consists of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Each recipe will have its own dedicated page, providing the ingredients and steps needed to prepare the dish.

## Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- **HTML Structure**: Understanding and implementing the basic structure of an HTML document, including the use of various tags such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
- **Linking Pages**: Creating a multi-page website by linking different HTML pages together.
- **Content Organization**: Organizing content in a clear and logical manner, making use of lists and other HTML elements to present recipes effectively.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using semantic HTML elements to improve the readability and accessibility of the web pages.

## Project Structure

The project will have the following structure:

```
/odin-recipes
│
├── index.html
├── recipes
│ ├── recipe1.html
│ ├── recipe2.html
│ └── recipe3.html
│
└── images
├── recipe1.jpg
├── recipe2.jpg
└── recipe3.jpg
```

- **index.html**: The main landing page that links to individual recipe pages.
- **recipes/**: A directory containing individual HTML files for each recipe.
- **images/**: A directory containing images for each recipe.

## Getting Started

To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. From there, you can navigate to the individual recipe pages.

## Self-Reflection

At the end of the project, I will revisit this README to reflect on what I have learned and achieved. This will help me consolidate my knowledge and identify any areas for improvement.

I hope you enjoy exploring my Odin Recipes project as much as I enjoyed building it. Happy cooking!
