      <li>1 ½ tablespoons sun-dried tomato spread</li>
      <li>5 large garlic cloves, grated</li>

      <li>chopped fresh basil (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Cook pasta in salted water according to package
        directions; drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato oil in a large skillet
        over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until pink on both sides and
        just cooked through, turning once, about 2 minutes per side; transfer to
        a separate bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sun-dried tomatoes, tomato spread, and garlic to the same skillet;
        cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in flour
        and continue cooking, stirring constantly, 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk in wine, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Bring to
        a simmer and cook, undisturbed, until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add broth, heavy cream, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and smoked
        paprika; whisk until fully combined. Reduce heat to medium and continue
        cooking, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened and just coats
        the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to low; add cooked pasta and shrimp to skillet. Cook,
        stirring often, until evenly coated and heated through, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat, garnish with basil and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
