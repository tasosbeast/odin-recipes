        <li>1 ½ tablespoons sun-dried tomato spread</li>
        <li>5 large garlic cloves, grated</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>chopped fresh basil (Optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather all ingredients. Cook pasta in salted water according to
          package directions; drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato oil in a large skillet
          over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until pink on both sides
          and just cooked through, turning once, about 2 minutes per side;
          transfer to a separate bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add sun-dried tomatoes, tomato spread, and garlic to the same skillet;
          cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in
          flour and continue cooking, stirring constantly, 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk in wine, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Bring
          to a simmer and cook, undisturbed, until slightly reduced, about 2
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add broth, heavy cream, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and smoked
          paprika; whisk until fully combined. Reduce heat to medium and
          continue cooking, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened and
          just coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce heat to low; add cooked pasta and shrimp to skillet. Cook,
          stirring often, until evenly coated and heated through, about 3
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat, garnish with basil and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
