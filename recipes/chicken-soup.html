        <li>
          Heat 1 tablespoon oil from sun-dried tomatoes in a large Dutch oven
          over medium until shimmering. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring
          often, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add tomato paste and sun-dried tomatoes; cook, stirring constantly,
          until tomato paste is slightly deeper red in color, about 2 minutes.

          Stir in broth, cream, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, garlic powder,
