    </h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound bacon</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package gnocchi</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly shaved Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a heavy skillet on the stove; lay bacon slices flat in the cold
        pan, without overlapping. Turn the stove to medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 5 to 7 minutes, the bacon should start to curl and brown. Use
        tongs to flip each slice over. Cook the other side until as crisp as you
        like, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove bacon from the pan; place it on a
        plate lined with paper towels to drain excess grease. Once cool enough
        to handle, roughly chop bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add gnocchi to the skillet. Do not stir. Cook for about 5 minutes. Add
        minced garlic. Sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken broth and slowly pour in cream; stir to combine. Add in
        Parmesan cheese. Stir to melt. Stir in bacon, sun dried tomatoes,
        Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes.
      </li>
    </ol>
